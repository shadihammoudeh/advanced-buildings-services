<p>Advanced Buildings Services (ABS) is a structural engineering consultancy firm founded by engineer Shadi Mahmoud Hammoudeh in 2021 with its headquarters in Amman, Jordan. The firm is registered with the Jordanian Engineers Association. Our services span across multiple sectors of the construction industry such as; residential, commercial, mixed-development, industrial, educational, healthcare, infrastructure as well as renovations and retrofits work.

ABS is committed to the delivery of top-notch structural solutions that are safe, efficient, robust and sustainable, with a razor-sharp focus to satisfy all of our clients’ requirements. Rest assured that each structural solution that we produce will be given our full attention, whereby each of its individual structural members will be thoroughly analysed and designed using industry’s latest structural analysis and design software. Moreover, the software’s outputs will be exhaustively questioned and investigated by our outstanding engineering judgement as well as excellent fundamentals understanding, in order to assure our clients’ that our high-quality generated drawings give blueprints only for the most efficient structural solution, thus, yielding tremendous projects’ savings. We promise you; we will not just simply cover our lack of structural engineering understanding by using the highest possible safety factors, which unfortunately is quite common nowadays in the majority of engineering firms.

At ABS we are fully aware that a structural skeleton on its own is of no use to anyone. Which is why every structural solution that we work on gets fully modelled in a Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment using industry’s leading software such as Autodesk Revit. To enable a holistic view to be taken on the integration of other services such as mechanical, electrical and plumbing as well as architectural façade, and how each one of them interacts with the structure. Thus, allowing for the early detection of clashes between different trades. Consequently, solving in advance for our client’s by appropriate coordination between various trades site’s issues that typically cause delays in projects’ schedules as well as increase the overall projects’ costs unnecessarily.
